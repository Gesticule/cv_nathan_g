ðŸ‘‹ Welcome FIC Visitors!
Thanks for scanning in!

I'm Nathan, currently completing a Specialized Masterâ€™s in Digital Forensics & Cybersecurity. Passionate about offensive security, I sharpen my skills through hands-on labs, red teaming scenarios, and CTF platforms like Hack The Box and RootMe.

Here, you'll find my CV (both in English and French), as well as a glimpse of my projects, skills, and security mindset.

ðŸš€ Looking to join a pentest or red team where I can keep learning and make a real impact.
Letâ€™s connect â€” and maybe weâ€™ll collaborate on something exciting soon.
